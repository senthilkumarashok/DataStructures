# DataStructures

  a brief introduction and explanation on interior architecture

# DataStructures and its interesting facts

  1. TreeMap is created using RedBlack Tree
  2. Autocomplete feature can be done through Trie
  3. Quick Select sort helps to find Kth smallest or largest element in array
  4. Improvements in Java 8 - For HashMap if hashcode collision count is more than 8 in a row , then its internal structure is  changed from linked list to tree

# Asymptotic analysis
  big- \Theta Θ notation, big-O notation, and big- \Omega Ω notation.

# Functions   
  
  Constant functions -  1
  Logarithmic functions - log n
  Linear functions  - n
  Linearithmic functions
  Polynomial functions - n~2, n~3
  Exponential functions 2~n

# BitWise Operators

  &	AND	Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1 (find number is odd or even)
  |	OR	Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1
  ^	XOR	Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1
  ~	NOT	Inverts all the bits
  <<	Zero fill left shift	Shifts left by pushing zeros in from the right and let the leftmost bits fall off
  >>	Signed right shift	Shifts right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall off
  >>>	Zero fill right shift	Shifts right by pushing zeros in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall off

# Lambda Expressions

	Functional Programming
	Pass behavior to OOP
	Functions as values
	Lambda as interface type
	Functional Interface - should have only one abstract method
