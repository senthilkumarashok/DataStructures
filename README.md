# DataStructures
a brief introduction and explanation on interior architecture

# DataStructures and its internal data structures
1. TreeMap is created using RedBlack Tree
2. Autocomplete feature can be done through Trie
3. Quick Select sort helps to find Kth smallest or largest element in array
4. Improvements in hashMap 8 if hashcode collision is more than 8in a row , then its internal structure is changed from linked list to tree


# Asymptotic analysis
big- \Theta Θ notation, big-O notation, and big- \Omega Ω notation.

# Functions and   
Constant functions -  1
Logarithmic functions - log n
Linear functions  - n
Linearithmic functions
Polynomial functions - n~2, n~3
Exponential functions 2~n
